# OneLayerNeuralNetwork

## Description
One-layer neural network which you can train to classify different languages that contains latin alphabet letters. In order to train the Neural Network you should create a file the text (it's better to have few books in particular language you want to recongnize). Program will take the text of the file and reconsturct it to the multi-dimensional Vector with each letter as different coordinate. In order to create the Perceptron that will difine one language you should pass this Vector to it. When you have at least two Perceptrons, you may create Neural Network and train it to recognize languages of the entered text
